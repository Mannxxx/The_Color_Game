The Color Game Project - JS and DOM Manipulation

The rules of the game are simple : you have to guess which color box matches with the RGB Color specified at the top.
You can also change the difficulty mode , in Easy, you have only 3 colored boxes; in Hard Mode, you have to guess within 6 colored boxes.
You can also change the colors by clicking at "New colors".
It was really a nice training for advanced DOM Manipulation in Vanilla JS.
The game is not mobile responsive for the moment.

Have a Good Game and enjoy !
